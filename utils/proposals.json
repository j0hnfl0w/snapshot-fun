    "body": "Read the formatted version of this proposal at:\nhttps://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103\nThe content below has been slightly edited for clarity on a text-only format (e.g. equations substituted from image to text).\n__\n\nProposal to modify the feeFactor curve by changing the exponential coefficient from 0.5 to 0.25. The effect would be to reduce the liquidity mining penalty for high-fee pools, thereby incentivizing a shift toward more profitable fees for liquidity providers.\n\nMotivation\n\nWhile the core motivation for liquidity mining is the equitable distribution of protocol governance power, economic incentives inevitably attract profit seekers. As such, it is important to align the incentives of those profit seekers with the best interests of the Balancer protocol. Liquidity providers may initially be attracted to Balancer by the profit opportunity that liquidity mining represents, but whether they ultimately stay with the protocol depends on their ability to generate revenue independent of BAL rewards. Above all, Balancer seeks to attract sustainable, long-term liquidity.\n\nAt present, the feeFactor curve is quite steep. Swap fees over 0.5% are sharply penalized, with rewards dropping into “negligible” territory around a 5% fee. There are two key consequences of this:\n\nLiquidity providers will set fees as low as possible in order to maximize BAL yield. Many existing pools with fees around ~0.1% are unprofitable in the absence of the BAL distribution and will not be able to outpace impermanent loss in the near future.\n\nLiquidity providers will not bother to weigh the tradeoffs of high trading fees, as >3%-fee pools will not earn much BAL at all and it is quite trivial to earn a high return by just parking some liquidity in a low-fee pool. This creates a disincentive toward certain novel use cases of Balancer such as the “swing trading” strategy proposed by Fernando here: https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/high-fee-balancer-pools-for-swing-trading-8bc1c169a4c2\n\nThe Proposal\n\nThe current fee factor takes the following form:\n\nfeeFactor = exp( -(fee/2) ^ 2 )\n\nIt can be generalized, replacing the constant factor (1/2) in the exponential with a coefficient called k.\n\nfeeFactor = exp( -(k*fee) ^ 2 )\n\nThis proposal is to change the value of this coefficient, k, from 0.5 to 0.25. This will have the effect of shifting the feeFactor curve to the right:\n\n<image showing the two feeFactor curves side by side>\n\nPractical Consequences\n\nThe effect on various common swap fees can be computed. Here are the results of the proposed change, taking the format (swap fee : old feeFactor => new feeFactor), where feeFactors are rounded to two decimal places.\n\n  0.1% : 1.00 => 1.00\n  0.2% : 0.99 => 1.00\n  0.3% : 0.98 => 0.99\n  0.5% : 0.94 => 0.98\n  1.0% : 0.78 => 0.94\n  2.0% : 0.37 => 0.78\n  3.0% : 0.11 => 0.57\n  5.0% : 0.00 => 0.21\n 10.0% : 0.00 => 0.00",

    "body": "[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/first-batch-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants/127)\n\n### TL,DR\n\nProposal to approve the first batch of grants of the Balancer ecosystem fund. This first batch will be comprised of 100k BAL, future batches will likely be smaller. To recap, [the idea of this 5M BAL fund](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) is to attract and incentivize strategic partners/stakeholders that will help the Balancer ecosystem grow and thrive.\n\n### Context\n\nThere are many projects and protocols that may want to integrate and/or build on Balancer. This is probably one of the most important areas for Balancer to thrive as a protocol and defend itself from new entrants or copycats. In many cases, it makes sense for Balancer to incentivize these integrations as these partners may need some extra motivation for them to feel staked within the Balancer ecosystem. Grants can also help partners convince their communities that Balancer is the right protocol to integrate their liquidity/users with.\n\nBalancer Labs will be responsible for deciding on the specific grant distribution to avoid governance micromanaging the decision process for each single grant. After a grant batch is fully allocated (if there is some left-over, it will be added to the following batch), a report with the grant allocation in that batch will be released to the community and a request for approval of a new batch will be voted on. This dynamics ensures that Balancer Labs has to do a good job at grant distribution since if this is not the case a new batch of grants might not be approved.\n\n### The Proposal\n\nA 100k BAL first batch of grants to be allocated by Balancer Labs to many teams/projects that are building on / contributing to Balancer. \n\nAll the grants have the long term alignment of incentives with Balancer protocol. Therefore, all grants awarded in this first batch will be given out as follows:\n* **90% of the grant is vested** linearly over 1 year (ensured by a smart contract)\n* **10% of the grant is unlocked**, but teams are expected **not to sell** these tokens, instead to distribute them to their project users or to hold them for voting on Balancer governance proposals.\n\n### Further Considerations\n\nBalancer Labs has started working with strategic partners and giving grants since before BAL was even launched. Many grants were given out based on the seed price of $0.60 per BAL, so this is why the high number of BAL tokens in this first batch. Future batches will probably be of 50k BAL, as individual grants are going to be a lot smaller given the current market price of BAL.",

The text below is an exact copy of it.\n\nTL,DR \n\nProposal to apply a wrapFactor = 0.2 to the liquidity of every pair of soft-pegged tokens for the purposes of liquidity mining distribution, in an effort to attract more useful liquidity to the protocol. \n\nContext \n\nThe original proposal 2 weeks ago applied a wrapFactor = 0.7 for soft-pegged tokens, i.e. tokens that track the same asset and are naturally highly correlated. These are being called soft-pegged pairs. Example: {USDC & mUSD}. \n\nLiquidity in soft-pegged pairs usually attracts relatively little trading volume on Balancer while at the same time exposing liquidity providers to a lower risk of impermanent loss. Many community members have expressed their concerns about this type of liquidity being unfairly highly compensated by the current mining distribution rules with their less useful liquidity. The introduction of 0.7 wrapFactor did not stop the explosion in size of soft-pegged pools chasing low risk yield on Balancer. Majority of publicity that Balancer recently got was related to sky high rewards for supplying soft-pegged liquidity. \n\nAfter much debate, it seems that 0.2 is a reasonable compromise. This value could be revised (up or down) at some point in the future, according to community sentiment regarding the practical results observed. This is unlikely to happen within the next month.\n\nThe Proposal \n\nFor every pair, we analyze: \n\nIs this a hard-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.1; \nIf not, is this a soft-pegged pair? If so, wrapFactor = 0.2; \nIf not, wrapFactor = 1.0 (i.e. no liquidity adjustment from the wrapFactor). \n\nExamples of soft-pegged groups: \n`{WBTC, renBTC, pBTC, sBTC, imBTC, cWBTC, BTC++}` (all track BTC), \n`{DAI, cUSDT, mUSD, USDC, sUSD, USD++, TUSD, yUSD-SEP20, aUSDT, aTUSD, aUSDC, aBUSD, oaUSDC, aSUSD, USDx, aDAI, yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD}` (all track USD), \netc. \nAll the above are pooled on Balancer. \n\nFurther Considerations \n\nAll liquidity in compliant ERC20 tokens is welcome in Balancer pools, but BAL distribution is a scarce weekly resource (i.e. for an LP to get more BAL, other LPs have to get less). Penalizing soft-pegs is the equivalent of giving an extra incentive for liquidity that has shown itself more useful to the protocol. The 0.2 value has been seen (by most community members) as a reasonable measure, that will be good for the future of Balancer. \n\nWe feel that liquidity composition on Uniswap is natural, while the composition on Balancer is highly skewed towards soft-pegged assets due to very generous rewards. We hope that liquidity composition will improve with wrapFactor 0.2. \n\nMany believe that the pools like the extreme examples below are earning rewards that are too generous: \n`WBTC-imBTC-pBTC-sBTC:` 1.2m liquidity, $0 24h volume \n`cUSDC-cUSDT:` $1.3m liquidity, $0 24h volume \n`cUSDC-cUSDT:` 1m liquidity, $0 24h volume \n`cUSDC-cDAI:` 200k liquidity, $0 24h volume`cUSDC-cDAI:` 200k liquidity, $0 24h volume",

    "title": "Proposal to Update the Whitelist Process",
    "body": "[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nProposal to modify the token whitelist process from the status quo. The method described circumvents the need for any subjective decision-making at the time of whitelisting, instead favoring a set of purely technical criteria. To protect the liquidity mining program from bad actors, a series of cap tiers is added to the capFactor computation (see the [original capFactor proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) for reference), with the default cap for new tokens being reduced to just $1M of adjusted liquidity.\n\n**Context**\n\nAfter seven weeks of whitelisting, we've begun to observe some serious contention within/regarding the existing token whitelist process. Namely, it is no longer acceptable for me (@rabmarut) to have subjective control over the list. There has been too much controversy recently about the interpretation of certain listing criteria, and no entity should have the power to make those interpretations.\n\nThe current criteria for whitelisting are described in the [original whitelist proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposing-the-token-whitelist-for-bal-distribution/55) and copied below:\n\n1. Token must return boolean success on transfer. If an ERC-20 does not return a bool when transfer() is called, it is broken within Balancer v1. Funds added to Balancer liquidity pools will be irrecoverable, and there is nothing the team can do to intervene; Balancer v1 is a set of immutable smart contracts with no administrative keys.\n2. Token must not charge fees on transfer. While not necessarily intended as an attack vector, transfer fees are dangerous for Balancer pools. Every trade or removal of liquidity from pools containing these assets will result in a pool price which is “out of sync” with the true balances. Arbitrageurs can gulp() the pool and then trade with it at liquidity providers’ expense. Among others, all “deflationary” assets fall into this category.\n3. Token contract must be verified on etherscan. This metric favors tokens which value transparency and reliability.\n4. Token must be listed and have a live USD price feed on CoinGecko. This is the price oracle used for distributing BAL proportional to shares of overall liquidity.\n5. Token distribution must be somewhat equitable. This is a highly subjective metric subject to community consensus, but in general the desire is for tokens to be somewhat evenly distributed. If the founders, for example, hold 90% of the supply, there are probably ways in which they can hurt liquidity providers or extract disproportionate BAL rewards by artificially driving up the token’s price.\n6. Token must provide some form of “real” value. This is another highly subjective metric, but the idea is for the community to actively filter out tokens which have been promoted as “pump-and-dump” schemes, which could hurt unknowing liquidity providers.\n\nIt seems clear that Criterion #6 is far too subjective and therefore prone to the curator's interpretation.\n\n**The Proposal**\n\nCriterion #6 (above) will be removed from the existing list, and Criteria #1-5 will fully govern the whitelisting process. That is, there will be a minimal set of _objective_ criteria for listing: a token must be technically compatible with Balancer, and its distribution must not raise any red flags as to the ability of a single party to game Balancer's liquidity mining program by manipulating either the token's price or supply. These criteria are fully focused on:\n\n1. Protecting Balancer liquidity providers from loss of funds.\n2. Protecting the BAL distribution from centralized actors.\n\nThe barrier to entry would be quite low for whitelisting tokens, but at any time, if a token is deemed to be either _maliciously harming LPs or gaming the BAL distribution_, it could be removed with a governance vote. Note that this approach passes no judgment on the intrinsic value of a token and leaves liquidity providers to decide for themselves what is and is not a \"good investment\" or a \"legitimate project.\" Tokens would never be omitted or removed from the list on subjective merits; rather, one of two explicit removal criteria must be met:\n\n1. There is significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that a fraudulent event took place in which token holders lost funds, i.e. an _exit scam_.\n2. The token is being used as a BAL farm, thereby disadvantaging other Balancer liquidity providers. For example, perhaps 80% of the token's supply sits in a Balancer pool with a 0.0001% fee, and it draws either very little or mostly inorganic trade volume. Care must be taken not to over-emphasize volume here, but it may _help_ to refine the list of potential manipulators. Another example of BAL farming could be that a single entity launches many different tokens to circumvent the $1M liquidity cap.\n\nIn calculating the week's BAL distribution, each token's total liquidity is adjusted by the feeFactor, ratioFactor, and wrapFactor; then the adjusted liquidity is capped at a predefined USD-denominated limit. This capFactor mechanism exists to ensure that no one token can reap a disproportionate share of the week's liquidity mining reward. To mitigate the potential consequences of the permissive listing scheme described above, I propose to make the default cap for each new token quite small. The capFactor system would be modified such that, instead of a single cap (now $10M) applied to all tokens, there would be several tiers of capping:\n\n```\ncap1:   $1M\ncap2:   $3M\ncap3:  $10M\ncap4:  $30M\ncap5: $100M\n```\n\nTo ease the transition to this new scheme, the status quo of a $10M cap will be maintained for all existing whitelisted tokens - this puts existing tokens at `cap3`. All new tokens, upon being added to the whitelist, would instead be capped by default at `cap1`. At any time, community members may propose to vote a token into a different cap tier. Though not an explicit requirement, the spirit of these changes would be that of reactive necessity rather than preemptive ranking: if a token's TVL on Balancer nears or exceeds that token's cap, vote to raise the cap to the next tier. All such votes would be conducted with three options, for the sake of fairness of governance:\n\n1. No change\n2. Migrate the token up to the next (adjacent) cap tier\n3. Migrate the token down to the previous (adjacent) cap tier\n\nFurthermore, the cap tiers themselves can be adjusted in value (scaled up or down) by vote, as market conditions may result in more or less USD-denominated TVL across Balancer pools. These votes would be far less frequent and more flexible in structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBalancer's liquidity mining program was always designed to be permissive. The introduction of a token whitelist was nothing more than a necessary evil to inhibit known attacks on the BAL token distribution. My hope is that the new cap structure and token removal criteria will prove strong enough to mitigate such attacks moving forward, while still enabling Balancer's trustless and permissionless vision.",

    "title": "Proposal to Introduce Liquidity Staking",
    "body": "[This proposal is also on Balancer's forum.](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-liquidity-staking/243). The proposed code to implement it can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/tree/liquidity-staking).\n\n# TLDR:\n\nProposal to have 45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity between BAL and uncapped tokens (WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC). Wallets flagged as Balancer Labs shareholders don't qualify for this \"liquidity staking\" extra incentive.\nThe main goals are to significantly increase liquidity on key BAL pairs and to allow non-shareholders to compound their BAL holdings at a much faster pace, accelerating protocol decentralization.\n\n![image|621x500, 50%](upload://5S3GvpjON1hNGnO7wuSfqNd3smk.png)   \n\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe **importance of BAL liquidity** can't be overstated:\n\n* *TRUER PRICE DISCOVERY*: it improves trading conditions for all market participants (lower spreads and less slippage for both buyers and sellers), allowing for a more transparent and effective price discovery process;\n\n* *SUPERIOR LP INCENTIVES*: a stronger token (with higher price inertia) results in a higher quality for the incentives given to LPs (liquidity providers) via liquidity mining;\n\n* *SHARPER GOVERNANCE*: it opens doors to a new class of invaluable stakeholders and protocol governors (e.g. larger investors, especially those heavily involved in and experienced with DeFi protocols);\n\n* *BROADER GOVERNANCE*: with no participation from Balancer Labs' shareholders (more on that later), liquidity staking will accelerate BAL distribution and protocol decentralization by giving all other BAL holders the opportunity to compound their governance rights at a much faster pace;\n\n* *SAFER GOVERNANCE*: pools are non-custodial and BAL in them retain full voting power (i.e. no need to withdraw liquidity to vote), such that high liquidity and a healthy governance are not in conflict;\n\nBalancer itself being a DEX, it feels only natural as the ideal venue for high BAL liquidity to be incentivized. Finally, it's worth noting that allowing a high portion of the token supply to be concentrated on *centralized* exchanges could expose the governance to significant risks, as illustrated by the episode with STEEM.\n\n\n# Recapping: how liquidity adjustment currently works\n\nThe 145k BAL [weekly distribution](https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/bal-liquidity-mining) to LPs on Balancer is calculated proportionally to the *adjusted* liquidity contributed by each LP. This adjustment is made by applying (i.e. multiplying) a few *factors* to their liquidity measured in dollar terms.\n\nNaturally, the value of those factors can be:\n* equal to `1`, having no effect;\n* less than `1`, acting as a penalty (when the liquidity is deemed less useful);\n* greater than `1`, acting as an extra incentive.\n\nA `feeFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-feefactor-toward-reducing-the-mining-penalty-for-high-fee-pools/103)) applies a small penalty to pools with higher fees.\n\n**For each pair inside a pool**, we apply:\n*  a `wrapFactor` of:\n   * `1.0` for uncorrelated pairs (no penalty),\n   * `0.2` for [soft pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/modifying-wrapfactor-applying-a-0-2-factor-to-soft-pegged-pairs/138),\n   * `0.1` for [hard pegs](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/wrapfactor-penalizing-pairs-of-equivalent-tokens-in-liquidity-mining/28); and \n\n* a `BRF` (BAL & Ratio Factor), which is the combination of a `ratioFactor ≤ 1` (see [proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/introduction-of-a-weight-ratio-factor-in-liquidity-mining/15)) and a `stakingBoost ≥ 1` (described in [this proposal](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102) and with further calculation details specified in its [ammendment](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/balfactor-incentivizing-bal-liquidity-on-balancer/102/4)). \n`BRF = stakingBoost * ratioFactor`\n  * If the pair is **not** of type `{BAL & uncapped_token}` (uncapped tokens currently being: WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, BAL), then its `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. the incentive doesn't apply to this pair).\n\nThe current `BRF` will only depend on the characteristics of the pool (its tokens and weights), and may have a maximum value of `1.54`. It looks like this:\n\n![image|690x455, 75%](upload://xqztRzplangZYzS0j70jlwfgc7P.png) \n\nAfter looping through all possible pairs in a pool, we combine their factors (via [weighted average](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/master/lib/factors.js#L111)) and the result is a `wrapFactor` and a `BRF` for the whole pool. \n\nFinally, we calculate and apply a `tokenCapFactor` adjusting down the liquidity of a token when it exceeds a predetermined maximum. Except for the 5 uncapped tokens already mentioned, all tokens eligible for liquidity mining are currently capped at $10M each. See more details on [how to calculate it](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56) and the [recent changes](https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217) to how token caps will evolve.\n\n# The Proposal\n\nThis is a proposal to have **45k BAL (~31% of the weekly distribution) allocated as an extra incentive for liquidity staking**.\n\nThis extra incentive is:\n\n> all BAL distributed as a result of applying a `stakingBoost > 1` to the liquidity of `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs, from wallets which are not flagged as shareholders of Balancer Labs.\n\nThe remaining **100k BAL would be distributed to all LPs** in all eligible pools, disconsidering the effect of a `stakingBoost` (i.e. all liquidity being subject to `BRF = ratioFactor`).\n\nThe constant value now would be: `STAKERS_SHARE = 45000 / 145000`, and we can then calculate the unique value for `stakingBoost` that satisfies this target distribution. \n\nThe intended result is for BAL liquidity on Balancer to increase substantially, **but in a self-regulated way**. \n\nThe simple yet powerful idea is: as BAL liquidity gets higher the extra incentive to staking gets **diluted among stakers**, so that our constant target for `STAKERS_SHARE` is met.\n\nIn a more visual approach:\n \n* when non-shareholder BAL liquidity is low, the `stakingBoost` will be high, resulting in a high `BRF` (a hypothetical scenario being the **orange** curve in the graph below, in which `BRF` peaks at `12`), so there will be a *very strong* incentive for BAL liquidity to increase;\n\n* when non-shareholer BAL liquidity is high (the desired scenario), the `stakingBoost` will have come down to lower levels, resulting in a lower BRF (a hypothetical scenario being the **green** curve below, in which `BRF` peaks at `3`).\n\n![image|621x500](upload://oI5XnPgsZE1VcQWDyeJCWovr1IV.png)  \n\n# Calculating the stakingBoost: a practical example\n\nWe first calculate the `liquidityPreStaking`: the total adjusted liquidity from applying all factors, but with `stakingBoost = 1` (i.e. `BRF = ratioFactor`). Let's say the result was $200M.\n\nWe will need to apply a yet unknown stakingBoost so that:\n```STAKERS_SHARE = (finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / finalLiquidity```\n\n... which can also be stated as:\n```finalLiquidity = liquidityPreStaking / (1 - STAKERS_SHARE)```\n\nIn our example:\n```finalLiquidity = $200M / (1 - 45000/145000) = $290M```\n\nWe may apply any temporary `tempStakingBoost > 1` to `{BAL & uncapped_token}` pairs from non-shareholder LPs, resulting in a `tempLiquidity`. Let's say our result was $230M. This would mean the `tempStakingBoost` increased the adjusted liquidity in $30M, while what we actually want is an increase of $90M.\n\nNow to get the desired `stakingBoost`, we only need to \"stretch\" or \"shrink\" the `tempStakingBoost` according to the ratio between the two liquidity adjustments (desired & temporary):\n\n```\n(finalLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) / (tempLiquidity - liquidityPreStaking) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost\n```\n... which in our example would result in:\n```\n(290 - 200) / (230 - 200) = stakingBoost / tempStakingBoost\nstakingBoost = 3 * tempStakingBoost\n```\n\n# Shareholder Addresses\n\nAn important aspect of this proposal is that Balancer Labs shareholders (investors, advisors and founders) seem aligned with the spirit of the proposal: to accelerate governance rights distribution. In order to achieve this goal, their wallets will be excluded from participating in liquidity staking. This restriction doesn't apply to eventual BAL they hold that are unrelated to their shareholder allocations, for instance BAL bought on the market or earned through being LPs with tokens other than their BAL shareholder allocation.\n\n[Here is the complete list of shareholder addresses to be excluded from liquidity staking](https://github.com/balancer-labs/bal-mining-scripts/blob/liquidity-staking/src/users.ts).\n\nNote: wallets currently tagged as \"Balancer: Shareholder XX\" on Etherscan are actually *vesting smart contracts* which hold mostly locked (i.e. yet unvested) BAL. Vesting happens continuously and linearly over a period of 3 years which started at token launch (2020-06-20). When finally vested (i.e. free to transfer), BAL can only be withdrawn to the respective beneficiary address of each vesting contract. The addresses listed above are the 51 unique beneficiaries of the 51 vesting contracts. All the BAL balance they already hold is vested.\n\nThe community is willing to tolerate up to about 10k BAL per week per shareholder being sent to centralized exchanges as they are cognizant of shareholders also seeking to deleverage their BAL positions over time, without attempting to subvert the exclusion list. In case some large BAL balances move to third-party custody solutions held in segregated addresses or to multisig wallets (both situations are likely to happen), the current list may be updated to reflect those new shareholder addresses as also excluded from liquidity staking.\n\nThe community will have the prerogative...

MKR has exceeded $10m adjusted liquidity for a period of time. MKR bring good liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**The Proposal**\n\nThis is a proposal to increase the MKR cap Tier from cap3 to cap4 ($10M -> $30M). MKR currently has $16M in adjusted liquidity and has probably surpassed it's $10M cap for a month.\n\nMKR brings useful liquidity to the Balancer ecosystem. Before, Uniswap used to be the most popular DEX for trading MKR.\n\n---\n\n**What is MKR?**\n\nMKR is a DeFi large cap, it currently has a $600M market cap. There's currently $1.5B locked in MakerDAO, and 425M DAI has been minted.\n\nSCD (Single Collateral DAI) was launched in December 2017. MCD (Multi Collateral DAI) was launched in November 2019.\n\nMakerDAO is a decentralized credit platform on Ethereum that supports DAI, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. Anyone can use Maker to open a Vault, lock in collateral such as ETH, BAT, or WBTC ... and generate Dai as debt against that collateral. Dai debt incurs a stability fee (i.e., continuously accruing interest), which is paid upon repayment of borrowed Dai. DAI is collected as system surplus, and then used in FLAP auctions to burn MKR.\n\nMKR can also be used as a governance token to govern the system. MKR holders also act as the last line of defense in case of a black swan event. If system-wide collateral value falls too low too fast, MKR is minted and sold on the open market to raise more collateral, diluting MKR holders.\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\nOriginal CapFactor Proposal: https://forum.balancer.finance/t/capfactor-capping-eligible-liquidity-to-10m-per-token/56\nNew Whitelisting Process: https://forum.balancer.finance/t/proposal-to-update-the-whitelist-process/217",

Buyers have no claims to Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd's assets which own the deposits that you make to get DZAR. The DZAR peg to ZAR (fiat currency) is kept at voluntary efforts of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd. and the pegging can be terminated at any point in time at discretion of Digital Rand (Pty) Ltd.\"\n\nDZAR can print unlimited amounts of tokens at their sole discretion.\n\nDZAR gets pooled in many 8 asset pools. These pools are as safe as the weakest currency, DZAR going to 0 will drain these pools to 0. There are millions in these pools. If DZAR prints unlimited amount of tokens, it will drain all these pools, generate large losses and bad publicity.\n\nI think that encouraging DZAR liquidity on Balancer creates a big risk for potential liquidity providers joining these pools.",

While there are many ideas on how the Yam protocol can be improved, we find it prudent to focus on minor updates that improve upon V1 with limited overhead.\n\n- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV\n- Replace YAMv1/yCRV sync() call on Uniswap V2 with YAMv3/yUSD sync() call\n- Hardcode proposal (50K pre-rebase) and quorum (200k pre-rebase) thresholds\n- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3 for quicker governance action\n- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol\n\nItem 2: YAMv3 Incentivization Distribution\n\nWe propose a single farming pool be established on the YAMv3/yUSD (yyCRV) Uniswap V2 LP pool. The first week of incentives will begin one hour after V3 launch and total 330,000 YAMv3. Incentives will be reduced by 30% each week, resulting in a total of 1.1MM YAMv3 tokens distributed to stakers. \n\nWe also propose a 1MM YAMv3 community fund, held outside the reserve in a separate community fund contract. This fund will be controlled by V3 governance, will not impact quorum requirements for voting, and can be used as the community sees fit. Uses may include but are not limited to new incentivized pools or ecosystem development initiatives.\n\nTL;DR:\n- YAM/yUSD LP Incentivized  Staking Pool, initial weekly issuance of 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totaling 1.1MM.\n- 1MM YAMv3 Community Fund\n\nItem 3: YAMv2 to YAMv3 Migration\n\nWe propose a 1:1 migration for YAMv2 holders. A migration contract with no deadline will be created, which will allow YAMv2 holders to burn their YAMv2 tokens in exchange for YAMv3 tokens.\n\nTL;DR:\n- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3 via migration contract\n\nItem 4: Delegator Rewards\n\nWe propose utilizing a snapshot taken at the time of the #saveyam governance proposal to reward delegators utilizing a “flat and scaled” reward model. The list of delegators can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json\n\nThe rewards will also be used to bring the total supply of YAMv3 to a round number, by the following calculation:\n\n (YAMv3 Total Supply) - (Community Fund) - (LP Pool Incentives) -  (YAMv2 Total Supply) = (Delegator Rewards)\n\nTotal delegator rewards will be approximately 173,588.383 YAMv3. We propose to distribute half (approximately 86,794.192) of these rewards on a flat basis to the 3,173 delegators, rewarding each delegate with approximately 27.354 YAMv3 tokens. The remaining 86,794.192 YAMv3 tokens will be distributed to delegators in proportion to their percentage of total votes delegated. This structure compensates small holders for their efforts and incurred transaction fees, as well as compensating all holders for their proportional impact.\n\nThese delegator rewards will be fully vested on V3 launch.\n\nTL;DR:\n- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed on flat scale to all delegators, half distributed proportional to voting contribution\n\nProposal Summary:\n\nTotal V3 Supply: 6,000,000\n\nProtocol Updates: \n- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV.\n- Call sync() on Uniswap V2 YAMv3/yUSD pool\n- Hardcode proposal (50K) and quorum (200k) thresholds\n- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3\n- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol\n\nFarming and Incentives:\n- YAM/yUSD LP Pool, receiving 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totalling 1.1M.\n- 1M YAMv3 Community Fund\n\nMigration: \n- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3\n\nDelegator Rewards:\n- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed equally to all delegators, half distributed according to a linear scale of voting contribution\n\nOnce again, this proposal is made by the individuals who originally launched YAM, and reflects our thoughts on how to best proceed. Ultimately, it is up to the community of YAM to decide, and proposals meeting the minimum requirements may supersede or iterate upon this proposal.\n",

    "body": "Hi Yamers, my nanme is Jimmy I am a system engineer. YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.\n\nIn order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is \"TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL\".\n\nAfter some discussion I come to the following proposal :\n\n1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal\n\nThe main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before any solution can be found. As a proof of my point there are around 40 new proposals which is to many for the community to digest at the time of my writing.\n\n2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Official Suggested Proposal\n\n3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal\n\nThe 2 tiers system that I proposal above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject a proposal.\n\nAs you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.\n\nLastly, please give me your support and vote to make YAM a better system.

Since ETH is the top pooled asset on Uniswap, it makes sense that we would want to encourage liquidity on the ETH-YAMv3 pool as well.\nYAMv1 saw people adding liquidity on the YAMv1-ETH pool (>$100k worth at its peak), unknowingly putting those funds at risk.",

If ratified, every funding from the YAM treasury that went to the Gitcoin Grants wallet would be 100% used for public goods funding for the Ethereum ecosystem.  This funding would be allocated to the [*Tech* Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/tech?) category.\n\nThis proposal was motivated by [a tweet from Nick Dodson](https://twitter.com/iamnickdodson/status/1294264371489767424?s=21 ).  There is plenty of discussion on that thread to checkout as you weigh your votes.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Gitcoin Grants is like a crypto-style patreon, powered by [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com), that has [delivered over $2.5mm of funding to Ethereum projects since Jan 2019](https://gitcoin.co/results).  For more on Gitcoin, checkout these reviews of Gitcoin Grants and QF \n- [Round 3 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html)\n- [Round 4 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html)\n- [Round 5 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/04/30/round5.html)\n- [Round 6 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/07/21/round6.html)\n\nThere are many promising projects in the community that support public goods (like ETH1/ETH2 development, L2 research, media, education, etc).  Given Gitcoin's long history of successfully supporting public goods on Ethereum at scale, without being captured, through a tough bear market, I believe Gitcoin is the strongest contender at the current moment, in this category.\n\nThere are two main reasons that I believe this is a good idea for the YAM community:\n1.  **Karma** -- Gitcoin Grants played a part in funding the transition form v1 => v2 [see this link](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1059/yam-protocol-audit). \n2. **High ROI Community Goodwill & Publicity**.  We can shift the narrative around YAMs being a \"degen\" project to having some \"regen\" effects to the ecosystem, like funding the base layer upon which it depends.  This will make YAMs part of the broader conversation around [rainbow colored money](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/rainbow-colored-money-the-story-behind) in the Ethereum ecosystem, and public goods funding in the information age.\n\nIf this proposal passes, I will commit to the following:\n1. 100% of the tokens that go to this wallet from the YAM contracts will be sent to public goods (minus gas fees, which I expect to be fairly negligible).\n2. Prominently listing YAMs as a co-funder of Gitcoin Grants Rounds, for each round it contributes funding.\n3. I would be happy to provide a report back to the YAM community on where the YAM funds went, once per quarter, for every quarter in which the value that the YAM system provided to Gitcoin Grants was more than $10k USD.\n\nI appreciate the consideration that the community has given to this proposal\nGitcoin Founder, [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki)",

    "body": "Abstract\nThe proposed delegator reward distribution in YIP-2 does not reward YAMv1 delegators sufficiently. 242,953 YAMv1 delegated to save YAM, yet according to YIP-2 only 173,588.83 YAMv3 will be awarded. This isn't even a 1:1 reward. Under this model, delegators will receive a fraction of their original delegated amount as rewards. This proposal would remove the flat-reward model specified in YIP-2, correctly quantify the amount of YAMv1 delegated, multiply this amount by 2x, and distribute them by address on a pro-rata basis. \n\nMotivation\nYAMv1 delegators are not getting sufficiently compensated for doing all they could to save YAM. Individuals who delegated, exited the YAM/yCrv pool which was yielding 100% ROI. These individuals also implicitly committed to staying out of the pool for 3 days and essentially missing out on a 300% ROI. \n\nThe official YAM twitter even indicated that the original intention was that delegators would get \"significantly more\" YAM than those who remained in the pool. \nhttps://twitter.com/YamFinance/status/1293739908721446912\nUnder the current model proposed in YIP-2, this is not the case. \n\nYIP-2 calculated delegator rewards of 173,588.383, while 242,953 YAMv1 was delegated to save YAM.

    "body": "Trent Elmore and Brock Elmore submit the following proposal to increase delegator rewards.\n\nWhile I believe the initial proposal was well in line with the expectations set, it has become apparent that many in the community disagree with the existing reward structure. Delegators showed great faith in the team and project, took on risk in showing this support, and are extremely valuable community members.\n\nMany argue that delegators should not only be recouped for opportunity cost, but rewarded more generally for their commitment to the project. I agree and believe that, in return, it is fair that the community ask for their continued support of the project.\n\nI propose a modification to the flat + scaled approach proposed in YIP-2: All delegators with votes equal to or less than 20 votes will receive a flat 20 YAMv3 reward, while all delegators with over 20 votes will receive a 1:1 reward. This ensures every delegator receives at least a 1:1 reward, whereas the original YIP-2 allocated some delegators significantly more than 1:1 and some significantly less.\n\nRewards breakdown:\n- Equal to or Under 20 YAM Delegated: 2,100 delegators * 20 YAM = 42,000 YAMv3\n- Over 20 YAM Delegated 1:1 = 290,665 YAMv3\n- Total Delegator Rewards: 332,665 YAMv3\n\nIn total, this is a 92% (~159k) increase in delegator rewards, and delegators will receive 6.6% of the network, not including the potential community fund.\n\nRather than being immediately vested, however, these rewards will be unvested over a 1 month period, streamed on a block-by-block basis. This will promote the continued engagement of the delegator community.\n\nIn order to keep the total V3 supply in line with YIP-2 and YIP-12 potential supplies, I also propose to decrease the total LP Pool rewards from 1.1M to 940,923, following the same distribution scheme leading to ~282k in rewards the first week, decreasing by 30% each week.\n\nI also propose that any rounding necessary to bring the supply to a whole number be left to developer discretion.\n\nFinally, I propose that should this proposal be passed, additional proposals relating to delegator rewards will be considered invalid. \n\nTL;DR:\n- Delegators with equal or under 20 votes receive 20 YAM\n- Delegators with more than 20 votes receive 1:1 reward\n- Total Rewards 332,665 (92% increase from YIP-2)\n- Rewards unvested over 1 month timeframe\n- Decrease LP rewards from 1.1M to ~941k\n- Rounding discretion to developer\n- No further delegator rewards proposals\n",

    "body": "Hi Yamers, my name is Jimmy I am a system engineer. YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.\n\nIn order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is \"TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL\".\n\nAfter some discussion I come to the following proposal :\n\n1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal\nThe main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before a solution can be found.\n\n2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Officail Suggested Proposal\n\n3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal\n\nThe 2 tiers system that I proposed above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject the proposal.\n\nAs you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.\n\nLastly, please give me your support on the YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) System to make YAMv3 a better system. Thank you.",

    "body": "This YAM Wallet has almost all Defi functions, through marketing creativity to satisfy all community members, to attract new users with marketing stimulation, and to maintain highly competitive strength in the long-term development with business model creativity. There are three steps to go.\n\n1. Short-term: YAM wallet issues a new tokens named Yamily(Yamy), partly used for airdrops to YAMv2 moved to YAMv3 holders, which can increase members’ centripetal force to the community and stimulates the price raising of YAMv3; partial tokens are used for private and crowd sale, It can greatly increase the financial income of the community,  also throw a high expectation of YAM Wallet and YAMv3’s launch to the public.\n2. Mid-term: Once the YAM wallet is launched, partial tokens be used as lottery rewards for the mining user, which can attract new users rushing into the pool, but users need to only go through the YAM wallet to enter the mining pool. There're three effects following--YAM wallet’s popularity, the rapid increasing users in mining pools, and the higher price expectations of YAMv3.\n3. Long-term: Become decentralized banking system, compatible with cryptocurrency and fiat currency, link crypto financial services in the physical world, further to change the global fiat currency financial system. (The specific approach is still to be discussed)\n\nThe distribution of YAM wallet tokens: \n10% for airdrop, \n30% for sale, \n20% for mining pool lotto rewards,\n  8% for wallet development team rewards, \n  2% for proposal rewards, \n30% as the executive team’s salary and ecosystem maintenance. \nThe time is on the clerk, executive details authorizes the project team to decide.\nI think this proposal can be a proper way to meet the interests of all community members, and will not cause the YAMv3 price to fall rapidly after the mining pool is exhausted; in the long-term development, the YAM community can also create a new Defi aspect. \nby Hanson\n",

    "body": "Abstract\nThe community was asked to delegate their YAM tokens before Aug 13, 7AM UTC in order to reach the required quorum to submit the proposal. However, the delegator snapshot was taken 55 blocks after 7AM UTC when the actual proposal was submitted. The team could have submitted the proposal in the first block mined after 7AM UTC, block #10650133. Some community members might have delegated their tokens before the deadline, but might have not been included in the snapshot. They were hurt the most.\n\nMotivation\nThe main objective of delegating YAM tokens was to reach the quorum for proposal submission. The team decided on the 7AM deadline. The team was also very vocal about keeping the tokens in the wallet and not moving them for 3 days until the voting ends. However, the second ask wasn’t the priority at that time. After successful proposal submission, there would be more than enough time to coordinate with the community all the steps required before the actual voting would take place.\n\nSome community members might have realized these nuances, proactively delegated their tokens so the proposal could have been submitted and moved their YAM tokens to Uniswap LP in > 1 block after 7AM UTC but less than 55 blocks after 7AM UTC when the snapshot was taken. They would be ready to move their tokens back to their wallets once the team/community would decide on the voting specifics (e.g. when the voting would take place).\n\nThese community members were hurt the most. Not only were they not included in the snapshot, they also got severely hit by the impermeant loss. On the other hand, some community members (including insiders) might have dumped their tokens right after the proposal was submitted. Not only were they included in the snapshot and will be part of the future governance, they also handsomely profited thanks to Uniswap liquidity providers.\n\nSpecifications\nTake delegator snapshot at block #10650187, the first block mined after the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "SIP-5 Make Sushiswap Safe",
    "body": "Background:\n\nUnlike recent forks, Sushiswap employs its own contracts, which means the risk of smart contract bugs are higher than protocols that simply fork other project's code.\n\nTo ensure long term survival of the Sushiswap platform and incentivize user loyalty, I propose a small percentage of the dev pool be used to incentivize $SUSHI holders to provide coverage for Sushi contracts on Nexus Mutual.\n\nInsurance products in DeFi are highly underexplored. Currently, Nexus Mutual is the only platform that supports the flexible coverage Sushi requires. In case of a smart contract bug that traps user funds, users who purchased cover on Nexus Mutual can be protected.\n\nBenefits:\n\nBenefit to liquidity providers: can insure against potential smart contract failure and loss of funds\n\nBenefit to users: signals developer confidence in contract security\n\nBenefit to developers: attract more demand for SUSHI as Sushiswap becomes a safer product.\n\nEconomics:\n\nThe development pool allocation currently sits at 10% of all inflation. A 10% cut of that means 1% of all inflation will be used to incentivize Nexus Mutual stakers.\n\nDuring the initial 10x bonus period (first two weeks since master chef contract goes live), 1000 SUSHI will be minted per block. After the first two weeks, 100 SUSHI will be minted per block.\n\nAssuming the price of $7/SUSHI and 10% of dev pool (1% of all inflation) is used to incentivize Nexus stakers, this implies roughly $7M first month, or $21M in SUSHI rewards. Currently there is roughly $22M staked for Uniswap contracts on Nexus; assuming conservatively that Sushi covers will be similar to Uniswap, this implies ~100% APY for those who provide insurance coverage for SUSHI.\n\nAlternatively, we can also explore using 5% of dev pool only, which will still result in a 50% APY for Nexus stakers. \n\nDetailed numbers here for review: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o293irtRAbIEYarY0x8EBMvHL8BF\ni4KaAtdtT1JYNAo/edit?usp=sharing",

Vote on this proposal if you agree that we should perform liquidity migration before the end of initial bonus reward distribution period. \n\nWith its own AMM, SushiSwap will be able to collect 1/6 of trading fees to distribute back to $SUSHI token holders. Note that liquidity migration requires no action from liquidity providers. The process will be seamless and everyone will maintain the same amount of LP tokens.\n\nIf this proposal passes, Chef Nomi will deploy all the necessary smart contracts - Migrator, SushiSwapFactory (UniswapFactory), SushiMaker, and SushiBar - and set \"setMigrator\" function call the Timelock smart contract. 48 hours after the timelock, liquidity migration will happen.\n\n---\nVoting period for this proposal is 1 day.

I have exposure to both SRM and SUSHI.\n\n\nProposal\n\nThe Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana\nSushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap\nProportional to the TLV in each\nOr alternately fixed to each pool\nThe Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks\nEach Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product\nThe pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve\nThis allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook\nFTX has a bridge from ERC20 <> SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, sollet.io will as well\nSushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1\n\nRewards\n\nEcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards:\n50k SRM for 1+2\n1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5\nOne MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together\nThis will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts\nThis will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that\nThese rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with\nIn addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it\n\nTimeline\n\nThe target would be for pieces of this to roll out within a month, and completion before the end of 2020.  The assumption is that work would not start in earnest until after the Sushiswap migration is complete.\n",

    "body": "### Summary\nThis proposal bundles a few improvements together which have compounding effects. It will solve for [gas subsidy](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/gas-costs-are-too-damn-high/4655), [gitcoin grants](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/direct-of-rewards-towards-ethereum-public-goods-funding/3699), inability to convert other Curve tokens into rewards for governance stakers.\n\n### Abstract\nAdd split functionality to TreasuryVault which can send the rewards to multiple destinations before sending them to governance staking contract. Add ability to withdraw from Curve pools. Add ability to trade using Uniswap.\n\n \n### Motivation\nThere is a very good [competing proposal](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/proposal-change-vault-harvest-function-to-reward-function-caller/4726) which solves for gas refunds by modifying `harvest()` function. But here is some rationale for using TreasuryVault instead:\n1. Putting this in `harvest()` doesn't refund on failed txs, which can eat up $500 by the moment it fails\n2. Requires redeploying and migrating all strategies, which can't be done easily for the strategies yDAI and yWETH vaults are currently positioned in.\n3. Treasury contract needs upgrading anyway, I was working on a converter and reward distribution bot and was stuck with OneSplit not being smart enough to unwrap Curve LP tokens.\n4. We'll be able to solve converting other assets finally and distribute the rewards accumulated from vaults other than yUSD.\n5. We can bundle this with gitcoin proposal, which is time-sensitive, since the next round starts on September 15th.\n\n### Specification\n1. Develop and deploy a TreasuryVaultV2 contract with these additional features:\n   - Ability to whitelist additional [CurveDeposit](https://www.curve.fi/contracts) contracts when more pools are created.\n   - Unwrap into underlying Curve LP coins or a single coin (CurveDeposit has us covered here).\n   - Trade via Uniswap in addition to OneSplit, this helps immensely with testing and optimizing the bot which does the trading.\n   - [Disperse](https://disperse.app)-like split functionality which can send different amounts to multiple recipients.\n   - The split functionality should also call `notifyRewardAmount` when it sends rewards to `ygov`.\n2. This proposal will require some additional work for gas accounting, which can be delegated to a bot.\n\n### Urgency\nGiven the gas costs are eating through our budget at $25k/day rate, I propose to have an expedited vote for this with a 1-day duration. We should have the implementation ready shortly after.",

    "body": "Background\nLet's face it, until we migrate the entire service to another blockchain, we are going to have to deal with paying ridiculously high GAS fees to ETH miners. And, it's already begun, in fact Mid-August saw total Ethereum GAS fees top a record $8.6 million in one day.\n\nThese GAS fees are like tapeworms that eat up all those great SUSHI gains LP's have come accustomed to seeing accrue on their screens. \n\nProposal\nChef Nomi implements code enabling a button that will give LP's a choice of harvesting of the SUSHI tokens as a group maybe once every 3, 6, 9 or 12 hours to save on such fees-- the longer the wait, the greater the savings.\n\nI realize this could be a lot of work to code, but I believe the GAS saving could be amazing. It will further incentivize LP's to reup and their restake even more ETH/SUSHI or other pairs, and at the very least, serve as a reward for those providing liquidity to the pool. \n\nI am not sure how much GAS we will save by doing this, but perhaps a portion of the savings could go back to the developers or go into a fund that will pay for the Nexus Mutual Insurance for the LPs or something like that. \n\nI don't have a UI mock-up or anything put together yet, but a fellow community member suggested a \"Karaoke Together\" button to allow this group harvesting capability. Below is how I imagine it working:\n\n1. LP goes to sushiswap.org and connects his/her wallet\n2. Clicks on the Home screen which instead of displaying only the existing 2 buttons showing your SUSHI balance and Total Supply;\n3. The LP can choose 1 of 2 more buttons under a title \"HARVEST YOUR SUSHI\" \n4. Button One reads \"Harvest via TAKE OUT\" for solo harvesting which uses more GAS;\n5. And the other reads, \"KARAOKE TOGETHER,\" and save GAS fees. \n\nOf course there could be links that explain the process to the user before they choose the option best for them. \n\nI am hoping someone in the community can build this mock this up really quickly and give @NomiChef a better visual of how this could look in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
